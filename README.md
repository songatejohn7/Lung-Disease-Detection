## Project Overview

Lung Diseases Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying various lung diseases from medical images such as X-rays and CT scans. The project leverages deep learning techniques to classify and detect diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and preparing medical image data.
- **Model Training**: Scripts to train deep learning models on medical image datasets.
- **Disease Detection**: Ability to detect and classify multiple lung diseases from images.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing training progress and model predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/songatejohn7/Lung-Diseases-Detection.git
cd Lung-Diseases-Detection
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Download the dataset**: Obtain the medical images dataset (e.g., Chest X-ray dataset) and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. **Preprocess the data**: Run the data preprocessing script.

```bash
python preprocess.py --input_dir data/raw --output_dir data/processed
```

### Training the Model

Train the model using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python train.py --data_dir data/processed --output_dir models
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_dir models --data_dir data/processed/test
```

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

```bash
python predict.py --model_dir models --image_path path/to/image.png
```

## Datasets

The project supports various public datasets for lung disease detection, such as:
- **Chest X-ray Dataset**: Contains images of patients with pneumonia and Covid19.
- **LUNA16 Dataset**: Contains CT scans for lung cancer detection.

Datasets should be downloaded and placed in the `data/raw` directory. Refer to the dataset-specific documentation for download instructions.

## Model Training

The training process involves:
1. **Loading the dataset**.
2. **Preprocessing the images** (resizing, normalization).
3. **Data augmentation** to improve model generalization.
4. **Defining the neural network architecture** (e.g., CNN, ResNet).
5. **Compiling the model** with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
6. **Training the model** using the training dataset.
7. **Saving the trained model** for future use.

## Evaluation

The evaluation process includes:
- **Loading the test dataset**.
- **Making predictions** on the test data.
- **Calculating performance metrics** such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualizing the results** using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Results

After training and evaluation, the results will be summarized in terms of:
- **Model performance metrics**.
- **Visualizations** of predictions versus actual labels.
- **Comparison with baseline models**.

Example of results visualization:

```bash
python visualize_results.py --model_dir models --data_dir data/processed/test
```
